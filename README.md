# Project Description: Othello Game-Playing AI 
In this project, we delve into the intricacies of game-playing algorithms and heuristics by focusing on Othello, a classic two-player strategy game, 
Othello is played on an 8x8 board with each player controlling pieces that are either black or white, 
The objective is to have the majority of pieces of your color on the board by the end of the game.

Our exploration includes:

* Implementing and analyzing various search algorithms to determine optimal moves.
* Developing heuristics to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the game-playing AI.
* Providing an interactive platform where you can play Othello to gain a better understanding of the game.
* Offering a comprehensive guide on the rules and strategies of Othello.
This project serves as a practical application of artificial intelligence concepts in a real-world scenario, providing insights into the development of competitive game-playing AIs.
