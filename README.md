In this project, we delve into the intricacies of game-playing algorithms and heuristics by focusing on Othello, a classic two-player strategy game, 
Othello is played on an 8x8 board with each player controlling pieces that are either black or white, 
The objective is to have the majority of pieces of your color on the board by the end of the game.

Our exploration includes:

* Implementing and analyzing various search algorithms to determine optimal moves.
* Developing heuristics to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the game-playing AI.
* Providing an interactive platform where you can play Othello to gain a better understanding of the game.
* Offering a comprehensive guide on the rules and strategies of Othello.
This project serves as a practical application of artificial intelligence concepts in a real-world scenario, providing insights into the development of competitive game-playing AIs.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML**: For structuring the content and layout of the web pages.
* **CSS**: For styling and designing the user interface.
* **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic, interactivity, and AI algorithms.

## Game Modes

</p>

There are 3 Game Modes as showing in the game panel:

* **Human Vs Human**: 2 players can play against each other locally.
* **Human Vs Computer**: : human can play against Ai with Difficulty from 0 (easiest mode) to 5 (hardest mode "human can't win").
* **Computer Vs Computer**: : 2 Ai players can go against each other with declaring each one difficulty level first and the code is delayed by 1 sec each turn so you can see each player turn .

## How To Run The Game

* Download github files as ZIP file.
* Extract in any location (make sure that html , css, js files are all in the same location).
* Open the html file using any browser.
* Choose the game mode , adjust the setting as needed and press play.
